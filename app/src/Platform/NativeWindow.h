/**
 * @class NativeWindow
 * @brief Provides native window customization features across different
 *        operating systems.
 *
 * The class offers a set of methods to modify and interact with the window
 * system at a native level. This includes setting the style of the window's
 * caption and calculating the title bar height based on the window's state and
 * operating system specifics.
 *
 * The actual behavior of the class methods are dependent on the operating
 * system on which the application is compiled and run. This allows for
 * platform-specific window customizations such as transparent title bars on
 * macOS or caption colorization on Windows.
